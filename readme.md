# Python Mini Projects

A collection of small Python projects and practice programs designed to help beginners and intermediate learners improve their coding skills.

##  What’s inside

This repository contains several mini-projects written in Python. Each project is self-contained and focuses on a specific concept, such as:

- `Rock_paper_scissor/` – A rock-paper-scissors game.
- `Tic_tac_toe/` – A tic-tac-toe game.
- `Student_management_system.py` – A simple student management console application.

> Each project is a runnable script (or folder) and can be used to practise logic, input/output handling, simple algorithms, control flow, and basic file operations.
